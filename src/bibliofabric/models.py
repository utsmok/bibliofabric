"""Core protocols and interfaces for the bibliofabric framework.

This module defines the essential protocols that enable the generic framework
to work with different API response structures through pluggable patterns.
The ResponseUnwrapper protocol is the key abstraction that allows any API
client implementation to define how their specific JSON response format
should be parsed and processed.

class ResponseUnwrapper(Protocol):
    """Protocol for unwrapping API-specific response structures.

    This protocol defines the interface that concrete implementations must
    satisfy to enable the generic bibliofabric framework to work with any
    API's response format. Each method handles a specific aspect of response
    parsing that varies between different APIs.

    The protocol enables a clean separation between generic HTTP client logic
    and API-specific response handling, making it easy to support new APIs
    by implementing this interface without modifying the core framework.

    Example:
        For an OpenAIRE API response like:
        ```json
        {
            "header": {
                "total": 1000,
                "nextCursor": "abc123"
            },
            "results": [
                {"id": "1", "title": "Paper 1"},
                {"id": "2", "title": "Paper 2"}
            ]
        }
        ```

        The OpenAIRE implementation would:
        - `unwrap_results()` → return response["results"]
        - `get_total_results()` → return response["header"]["total"]
        - `get_next_page_token()` → return response["header"]["nextCursor"]
